    <p>What month in a year is good time to start a garden?
        If you're new to gardening, you may think the growing season doesn't begin until April or May. You can start planting seeds much earlier. If you start the right plants now, you'll likely be harvesting your own fresh veggies or flowers blooming by March or April.</p>
    <h2>10 Top Gardening Tips for Beginners</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Site it right. Starting a garden is just like real estate it's all about location. (out of sight, out of mind definitely applies to gardening)</li>
        <li>Follow the sun.Most plants need at least 6 hours of sun in order to thrive.</li>
        <li>Stay close to water.Make sure you can run a hose to your garden site, so you don't have to lug water to it each time your plants get thirsty.</li>
        <li>Start with great soil.invest in soil that is nutrient-rich and well-drained.</li>
        <li>Choose the right plants per season.sun-loving plants into a sunny spot, choosing heat-tolerant plants in warm climates,</li>
        <li>Discover your zone."hardiness zone" can help you choose the best plants. </li>

        <li>Consider containers. They add beauty elements. </li>
        <li>Add 2 to 3 inches deep mulch around each plant help reduce weeds by blocking out the sun, and reduce moisture loss.</li>
